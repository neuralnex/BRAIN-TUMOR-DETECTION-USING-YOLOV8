Roboflow Brain Tumor Detection Model
This repository contains a trained deep learning model for detecting brain tumors using Roboflow. The model has been trained on a dataset of brain MRI images labeled with tumor regions.

Usage
To use this model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the detect_tumor.py script, providing the path to the MRI image you want to analyze.

Model
The model architecture used for this task is a convolutional neural network (CNN) (yolov8) trained on a dataset of labeled brain MRI images. The architecture has been optimized for high accuracy and efficiency in detecting brain tumors.

Dataset
The dataset used for training this model consists of brain MRI images collected from various medical sources. The images are labeled with the regions corresponding to tumor presence, allowing the model to learn to identify tumors accurately.

Evaluation
The model's performance has been evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, the model has been tested on a separate validation dataset to assess its generalization capabilities.

Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the creators of the dataset used for training this model, as well as the developers of the deep learning frameworks and tools utilized in the training process.
